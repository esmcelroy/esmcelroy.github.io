# Hello World!~

After more than a decade since my last interaction with blogging, I've decided it's time to put a blog back together. No commitments on how often this gets updated, but you could expect content related to tech (cloud, devops, consumer tech), transit (mostly Toronto-centric), maybe some light politics (but not too much...), travel, etc...

Looking forward to getting back to writing!

Cheers,
-Eric
